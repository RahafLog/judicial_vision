## Introduction 

in this Hackathon, we focus on developing ChatBot as a new function on our project.

Leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) and Langchain technologies, we have successfully developed a chatbot. This chatbot is designed to respond accurately to questions pertaining to legal cases, utilizing data sourced from the Saudi Judges Portal. The precise prompts crafted ensure the bot's ability to provide insightful answers and assistance related to the given case data. This innovative solution aims to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial process in accordance with the Vision 2030 objectives.
